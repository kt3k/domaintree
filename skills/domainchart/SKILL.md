# domainchart

A skill for expressing a DDD domain as a **hierarchy of domain objects** that
can be rendered as a tree-style diagram. The focus is on modeling the structure
correctly; the renderer is just a thin step at the end.

## Scope (argument)

The skill takes an optional argument that names the **scope** to analyze — file
paths, directory paths, or a free-form description (e.g. "the billing module").
When no argument is given, treat the **entire codebase** as the scope.

## Workflow

Execute the steps below in order. Do not skip ahead.

1. **Read the code in scope.** Carefully read every file under the given scope
   (or the whole repository if no argument was provided). Note classes, types,
   structs, schemas, and any data structures that look like domain concepts.
2. **List the domain objects.** Enumerate each candidate as either an Entity
   (identity-bearing, independent lifecycle — 🔷) or a Value Object (defined
   purely by its attributes, interchangeable when equal — 💎). IDs like
   `OrderId` / `UserId` are Value Objects. One node per concept; don't merge.
3. **Read `npx domainchart types`.** Run the command and read its JSON Schema
   output. This is the authoritative input shape — do not guess the schema from
   memory.
4. **Map the listed objects to that schema.** Produce a JSON document that
   conforms to the schema from step 3:
   - Use a child's `name` as the parent property's `type` to express the
     parent→child edge. Collections / optionals / unions all count as
     references: `OrderItem[]`, `Array<OrderItem>`, `Set<OrderItem>`,
     `OrderItem?`, `Foo | Bar`, `Array<Foo | Bar>`.
   - Any `type` that does not match a declared `name` is a primitive leaf
     (`string`, `number`, `Date`, …).
   - Pick aggregate roots intentionally — a root owns its children, and children
     should be reachable only through their root. Break cross-aggregate cycles
     by referencing the other root's ID, not the root itself.
5. **Save the JSON to a temp directory.** Create one with `mktemp -d` and write
   the document to `<tmp>/domainchart.json`. Do not write to the project yet.
6. **Validate.** Run `npx domainchart validate <tmp>/domainchart.json`. If any
   errors or warnings are reported, fix the JSON and re-run. **Repeat until the
   output is clean.**
7. **Build the HTML.** Run
   `npx domainchart build <tmp>/domainchart.json -o <tmp>/domainchart.html`.
8. **Open it in a browser** so the user can see the result
   (`open
   <tmp>/domainchart.html` on macOS).
9. **Ask whether to keep it.** Ask the user whether to copy `domainchart.json`
   and `domainchart.html` into the project, and where. Only copy if they
   confirm.

## Hierarchy design guidelines

- **One root per aggregate.** If two candidates both want to own the same child,
  decide which truly owns it; the other should reference it by ID (a Value
  Object like `OrderId`) instead of by object.
- **Break cross-aggregate cycles with ID references.** A direct object reference
  to `OtherAggregateRoot` creates a child edge; referencing its ID
  (`OtherAggregateRootId` as a Value Object) keeps the two aggregates separate.
- **Cycles with no clear root are rejected.** If the validator complains, the
  hierarchy is ambiguous — pick a root or break the cycle via an ID.
- **Depth follows ownership, not data flow.** Put a property under its owner,
  not under whoever happens to read it.

## Example

```json
{
  "title": "EC Site Domain Model",
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "Order",
      "kind": "entity",
      "description": "Order aggregate root",
      "properties": [
        { "name": "id", "type": "OrderId" },
        { "name": "items", "type": "OrderItem[]" },
        { "name": "customerId", "type": "CustomerId" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "OrderItem",
      "kind": "entity",
      "properties": [
        { "name": "quantity", "type": "number" },
        { "name": "unitPrice", "type": "Money" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Money",
      "kind": "value_object",
      "properties": [
        { "name": "amount", "type": "number" },
        { "name": "currency", "type": "string" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "OrderId",
      "kind": "value_object",
      "properties": [{ "name": "value", "type": "string" }]
    },
    {
      "name": "CustomerId",
      "kind": "value_object",
      "properties": [{ "name": "value", "type": "string" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

Inferred result: `Order` becomes the aggregate root, owning `OrderItem` (which
owns `Money`) and `OrderId`. `CustomerId` is a leaf — the `Customer` aggregate
is referenced only by ID, keeping the two aggregates separate.
